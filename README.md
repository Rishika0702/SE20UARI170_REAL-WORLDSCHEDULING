#### Efficiency and Fairness Discussion

Efficiency: The Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm often minimizes the average waiting time and turnaround time, making it the most effective. Patients with the quickest anticipated treatment times receive priority.

Fairness: Priority Scheduling (PS) based on urgency level can be regarded as fair because it treats patients in accordance with their level of urgency, giving more urgent situations higher priority.
