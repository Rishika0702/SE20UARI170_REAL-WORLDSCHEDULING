#### Efficiency and Fairness Discussion

Efficiency: The Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm often minimizes the average waiting time and turnaround time, making it the most effective. Patients with the quickest anticipated treatment times receive priority.

Fairness: Priority Scheduling (PS) based on urgency level can be regarded as fair because it treats patients in accordance with their level of urgency, giving more urgent situations higher priority.

In Real World Scenario Round Robin is not preferable as it is premptive.
